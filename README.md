**Version:
opencv version 3 is needed.

Save all files in one single location and update the path in all scripts.

Commands:
Install packages using following commands:

1.pip install opencv-python (make sure it's open cv version 3)
2.pip install keyboard
3.pip install pyautogui
4.pip install numpy

Run the main file and start your gesture presentation.

XML file functions:
fin_2 is used for next slide,
point is used for previous slide,
ok is used to zoom in,
hand is used to zoom out,

You can add any additional functions using above gestures gesture.

**right now only fin_2 (two fingers) --> next slide is working with ease.
**still facing issues with the influence on slides as it gets continuous inputs and that causes the slides to abruptly and continously without delay.

Hand gestures examples are shown in images.
